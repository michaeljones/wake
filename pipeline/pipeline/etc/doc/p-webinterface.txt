Werkzeug is used for the web server interface.

The application is created in pipeline.dispatch.web

The WebInterface base class can be found in pipeline.interface.web. This class should be subclassed to create the web interface for each module. The base class provides a process_request method for parsing the url and calling the right method. Subclasses should override the url_map class attribute and provide there own methods.

The base class calls the relevant method indicated by the URL and then tries to process the matching template and display that. 

A base template is provided as etc/web/layout.mako and styled in etc/web/default.css. 

TODO:
- Provide a method for redirecting to another URL in the same fashion that rails provides.
